      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>To many, the lives of the saints seem more story than history; the Catholic Genealogical Society aims to promote and to make tangible our living ties to the saints. The Society is a Catholic community of research, fellowship, and high purpose, dedicated to the memory of the saints.</p>
      <p>While independent in organization and structure, The Society entrusts its spirituality fully to its local diocese and the Holy mother Church. It is composed of practicing Catholics who are proven descendants of saints canonized by the Holy Catholic Church. Membership is upon board approval as listed on our membership page.</p>
      <p>The Catholic Genealogical Society invites you to join us in this sanctifying mission.</p>
